<h3 class="title">centrifugal force</h3>

<p>This is a great outdoor activity and was one of the class favorites of the year.</p>

<p>Preparation:<br />
- one paper cup for each student (use a strong one, like those made for hot drinks<br />
- Tie a string to the cup by making two hole near the top across from each other and create a loop.  Make it just long enough so that if a child holds the string with their arm relaxed, the cup will not touch the ground.<br />
- for each child: one penny, one small ball<br />
- a large bucket of water</p>

<p>By now, we've learned about different kinds of forces forces.  I asked the kids to name some (magnetism, gravity).  I demonstrated gravity by dropping a penny in a cup.  Gravity makes the penny stick to the bottom of the cup.  If I turn the cup upside-down, the force of gravity makes the penny fall out.  I told the class that I had a challenge for them.  Did they think they could make it so when the cup is upside-down the penny didn't fall out?  They all believed it was impossible.  I told them that I would give them the materials for an experiment and that they were to try to keep the penny in the cup when the cup is upside-down.  I pointed out that attached to each cup is a piece of string -- that's a hint.</p>

<p>We then went outside and let them each play with a penny, cup and string.  Some of them learned by swinging the cup that the penny would stay inside; some of them twirled the cup on the string; and, of course, once most of the kids had figured it out they all saw how easy it was.  There was a great joy of discovery.</p>

<p>I proceeded to give them the next challenge.  They all exchanged the penny for a ball.  This one went fairly quickly.  They all had fun exploring this new concept with a different prop.</p>

<p>When they had all mastered the second challenge, I explained that they now had to keep water in the cup.  There were a few doubters, but they all were excited to give it a try.  Everyone was successful and they kept at it till most of the cups had gotten soggy or fallen apart from the strain.</p>
